            <h1>INTRODUCING</h1>
            <h2>FATTY BURGER</h2>
            <p>The term "burger" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom,
                where the term "patty" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the
                term
                hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity "burger" may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat
                substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie
                burger.
